Project was created using React, Tailwind, React Hook Form, Axios.
Fully responsinve accordion forms, connected with a sqllite3 database.
Only the Details form will submit to database and it will also submit empty strings (Needed a bit more time to complete all the other functionalities but this should at least showcase the functionality behind it).
The server is set to run on http://localhost:8888/ and it will need to be started using the command nodemon.
